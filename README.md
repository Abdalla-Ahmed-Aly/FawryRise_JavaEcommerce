üöÄ How It Works
This Java console-based e-commerce simulation models a simplified shopping and checkout process. The system demonstrates core object-oriented principles including encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.

üõí Features:
Product Management
Multiple product types including perishable (e.g., Cheese, Biscuits) and non-perishable (e.g., TV, ScratchCard).
Products may or may not be shippable or expirable.

Cart Operations
Customers can add items to the cart, and quantities are validated against stock availability.

Checkout Process

Verifies product expiration and stock quantity

Calculates the subtotal of all cart items

Computes shipping costs based on total package weight

Deducts the total amount from the customer's balance

Reduces the product quantities accordingly

Shipping Logic

Shippable items are listed with quantities and weights

Shipping cost is calculated as:
Shipping Cost = Total Weight √ó 30 LE
